# grunt-lyria-assets

> Preparation of Lyria assets

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-lyria-assets --save-dev
```

This grunt task simiplies the workflow when working with the Lyria game framewok, see: https://github.com/freezedev/lyria.  
For an example how this could be used, take a look at the Lyria template: https://github.com/freezedev/lyria-template.  

## Contributing
